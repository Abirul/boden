	/** Asks the view core to calculate its preferred size in DIPs (see UiLength::Unit::dip),
        based on it current content	and properties.
        
		availableWidth and availableHeight are used to indicate the maximum amount of available
		space for the view (also in DIPs). If they are both -1 then that means that the available space should be considered to be unlimited.
		I.e. the function should return the view's optimal size.

		When one of the availableXYZ parameters is not -1 then it means that the available space is limited
		in that dimension. The function should return the preferred size of the view within those constraints,
		trying to not exceed the limited size component.
		
		For example, many views displaying text can handle a limited available width by wrapping the text into
		multiple lines (and thus increasing their height).

		If the view cannot reduce its size to fit into the available space then it is valid for the function
		to return a size that exceeds the available space. However, the layout manager is free to
		size the view to something smaller than the returned preferred size.

        calcPreferredSize should take the View::minSize and View::maxSize properties of the outer view into account
        and clip or extend the result accordingly. In rare cases, if the minSize and/or maxSize absolutely
        do not make sense for the view implementation then the function may also return a preferred size that exceeds
        these bounds. Implementors of calcPreferredSize can use the helper function
        View::applySizeConstraints() to apply minSize and maxSize.

        IMPORTANT: It is perfectly ok (even recommended) for the view to return a preferred size
        that is not adjusted for the constraints of the current display yet. I.e. it may not be rounded
        to full physical pixels yet.
        Use adjustBounds() to adjust the returned size to something that can actually be represented on the display.
