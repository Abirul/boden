# API Reference Overview

This part of the Boden Framework documentation provides a reference to make looking up specific Boden classes and types easy. If you are interested in learning how to write apps in Boden, consider the [Getting Started](../getting-started) and [Guides](../guides) sections instead.

!!! warning
	The Boden API is work in progress and may change in the coming months. We are currently aiming at providing the first stable API by Q3/2019. [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bodenhq) and [star/watch our repo on GitHub](https://github.com/AshampooSystems/boden) to stay in the loop!

The Boden API is organized into four principal modules:

### Foundation

The Foundation module provides essential base classes, data structures, type definitions, and operating system services for use in your application.

### UI

The UI module contains all classes, types, and widgets required for building user interfaces with Boden. All widgets shipped with the Boden Framework are available in this module.

### Net

The Net module provides essential networking services for apps written with Boden.

### Layout

The Layout module contains base classes, interfaces, and layout implementations required for laying out Boden-based user interfaces.
